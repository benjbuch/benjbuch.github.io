- abstract: Mammalian genomes are regulated by epigenetic cytosine (C) modifications
    in palindromic CpG dyads. Including canonical cytosine 5‐methylation
    (mC), a total of four different 5‐modifications can theoretically co‐exist
    in the two strands of a CpG, giving rise to a complex array of combinatorial
    marks with unique regulatory potentials. While tailored readers for
    individual marks could serve as versatile tools to study their functions,
    it has been unclear whether a natural protein scaffold would allow selective
    recognition of marks that vastly differ from canonical, symmetrically
    methylated CpGs. We conduct directed evolution experiments to generate
    readers of 5‐carboxylcytosine (caC) dyads based on the methyl‐CpG‐binding
    domain (MBD), the widely conserved natural reader of mC. Despite the
    stark steric and chemical differences to mC, we discover highly selective,
    low nanomolar binders of symmetric and asymmetric caC‐dyads. Together
    with mutational and modelling studies, our findings reveal a striking
    evolutionary flexibility of the MBD scaffold, allowing it to completely
    abandon its conserved mC recognition mode in favour of noncanonical
    dyad recognition, highlighting its potential for epigenetic reader design.
    Cytosine 5‐modifications–occurring in different combinations in the
    two DNA strands of CpG dyads–are central to human chromatin regulation,
    but the customized recognition of such combinatorial marks is challenging.
    By re‐evolving MBDs, the readers of canonical 5‐methylated CpGs, we
    identify strong and selective readers of noncanonical 5‐carboxylcytosine‐containing
    CpGs that have fully abandoned the conserved recognition of methylated
    CpGs.

- abstract: 5-methylcytosine (mC) and its TET-oxidized derivatives exist
    in CpG dyads of mammalian DNA and regulate cell fate, but how their
    individual combinations in the two strands of a CpG act as distinct
    regulatory signals is poorly understood. Readers that selectively recognize
    such novel ‘CpG duplex marks’ could be versatile tools for studying
    their biological functions, but their design represents an unprecedented
    selectivity challenge. By mutational studies, NMR relaxation, and MD
    simulations, we here show that the selectivity of the first designer
    reader for an oxidized CpG duplex mark hinges on precisely tempered
    conformational plasticity of the scaffold adopted during directed evolution.
    Our observations reveal the critical aspect of defined motional features
    in this novel reader for affinity and specificity in the DNA/protein
    interaction, providing unexpected prospects for further design progress
    in this novel area of DNA recognition.

- abstract: RNA-binding proteins are essential regulators of RNA processing
    and function. Translational repression assays can be used to study how
    they interact with specific RNA sequences by insertion of such a consensus
    sequence into the 5’ untranslated region of a reporter mRNA and measuring
    reporter protein translation. The straightforward set-up of these translational
    repression assays avoids the need for the isolation of the protein or
    the RNA providing speed, robustness and a low-cost method. Here, we
    report the optimization of the assay to function with linear RNA sequences
    instead of the previously reported hairpin type sequences to allow the
    study of a wider variety of RNA-binding proteins. Multiplication of
    a consensus sequence strongly improves the signal allowing analysis
    by both fluorescence intensity measurements and flow cytometry.

- abstract: Transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) are programmable
    DNA binding proteins that can be used for sequence-specific, imaging-based
    analysis of cellular 5-methylcytosine. However, this has so far been
    limited to highly repetitive satellite DNA. To expand this approach
    to the analysis of coding single gene loci, we here explore a number
    of signal amplification strategies for increasing imaging sensitivity
    with TALEs. We develop a straightforward amplification protocol and
    employ it to target the MUC4 gene, which features only a small cluster
    of repeat sequences. This offers high sensitivity imaging of MUC4, and
    in costaining experiments with pairs of one TALE selective for unmethylated
    cytosine and one universal control TALE enables analyzing methylation
    changes in the target independently of changes in target accessibility.
    These advancements offer prospects for 5-methylcytosine analysis at
    coding, nonrepetitive gene loci by the use of designed TALE probe collections.

- abstract: Ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases (TETs) are the erasers
    of 5-methylcytosine (mC), the central epigenetic regulator of mammalian
    DNA. TETs convert mC to three oxidized derivatives with unique physicochemical
    properties and inherent regulatory potential, and it initializes active
    demethylation by the base excision repair pathway. Potent small molecule
    inhibitors would be useful tools to study TET functions by conditional
    control. To facilitate the discovery of such tools, we here report a
    high-throughput screening pipeline and its application to screen and
    validate 31.5k compounds for inhibition of TET2. Using a homogenous
    fluorescence assay, we discover a novel quinoline-based scaffold that
    we further validate with an orthogonal semi-high throughput MALDI-MS
    assay for direct monitoring of substrate turnover. Structure–activity
    relationship (SAR) studies involving >20 derivatives of this scaffold
    led to the identification of optimized inhibitors, and together with
    computational studies suggested a plausible model for its mode of action.

- abstract: 5-Methylcytosine (mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC), the
    two main epigenetic modifications of mammalian DNA, exist in symmetric
    and asymmetric combinations in the two strands of CpG dyads. However,
    revealing such combinations in single DNA duplexes is a significant
    challenge. Here, we evolve methyl-CpG-binding domains (MBDs) derived
    from MeCP2 by bacterial cell surface display, resulting in the first
    affinity probes for hmC/mC CpGs. One mutant has low nanomolar affinity
    for a single hmC/mC CpG, discriminates against all 14 other modified
    CpG dyads, and rivals the selectivity of wild-type MeCP2. Structural
    studies indicate that this protein has a conserved scaffold and recognizes
    hmC and mC with two dedicated sets of residues. The mutant allows us
    to selectively address and enrich hmC/mC-containing DNA fragments from
    genomic DNA backgrounds. We anticipate that this novel probe will be
    a versatile tool to unravel the function of hmC/mC marks in diverse
    aspects of chromatin biology.

- abstract: Transcription-activator like effectors (TALEs) are DNA-binding
    proteins used for genome targeting. TALEs contain a central domain of
    concatenated repeats, of which each selectively recognizes one nucleobase
    at the DNA major groove. Based on this simple and predictable interaction
    with little context dependence, TALEs offer programmable targeting of
    user-defined DNA sequences. Since many epigenetic DNA modifications
    protrude into the DNA major groove, natural and engineered TALE repeats
    can provide “epigenetic” selectivity, making TALEs a flexible platform
    to design probes for the analysis of epigenetic DNA modifications. Here,
    we describe guidelines for the design of TALE proteins with selectivity
    for epigenetic cytosine 5-modifications, the validation of their interaction
    with modified DNA nucleobases, and their employment in affinity enrichment
    assays. These techniques enable quantification of epigenetic nucleobases
    in user-defined genomic DNA sequences with nucleotide and strand resolution.

- abstract: Modifications of the cytosine 5-position are dynamic epigenetic
    marks of mammalian DNA with important regulatory roles in development
    and disease. Unraveling biological functions of such modified nucleobases
    is tightly connected with the potential of available methods for their
    analysis. Whereas genome-wide nucleobase quantification and mapping
    are first-line analyses, targeted analyses move into focus the more
    genomic sites with high biological significance are identified. We here
    review recent developments in an emerging field that addresses such
    targeted analyses via probes that combine a programmable, sequence-specific
    DNA-binding domain with the ability to directly recognize or cross-link
    an epigenetically modified nucleobase of interest. We highlight how
    such probes offer simple, high-resolution nucleobase analyses in vitro
    and enable in situ correlations between a nucleobase and other chromatin
    regulatory elements at user-defined loci on the single-cell level by
    imaging.

- abstract: 'Transcription‐activator‐like effectors (TALEs) are repeat‐based,
    programmable DNA‐binding proteins that can be engineered to recognize
    sequences of canonical and epigenetically modified nucleobases. Fluorescent
    TALEs can be used for the imaging‐based analysis of cellular 5‐methylcytosine
    (5 mC) in repetitive DNA sequences. This is based on recording fluorescence
    ratios from cell co‐stains with two TALEs: an analytical TALE targeting
    the cytosine (C) position of interest through a C‐selective repeat that
    is blocked by 5 mC, and a control TALE targeting the position with a
    universal repeat that binds both C and 5 mC. To enhance this approach,
    we report herein the development of novel 5 mC‐selective repeats and
    their integration into TALEs that can replace universal TALEs in imaging‐based
    5 mC analysis, resulting in a methylation‐dependent response of both
    TALEs. We screened a library of size‐reduced repeats and identified
    several 5 mC binders. Compared to the 5 mC‐binding repeat of natural
    TALEs and to the universal repeat, two repeats containing aromatic residues
    showed enhancement of 5 mC binding and selectivity in cellular transcription
    activation and electromobility shift assays, respectively. In co‐stains
    of cellular SATIII DNA with a corresponding C‐selective TALE, this selectivity
    results in a positive methylation response of the new TALE, offering
    perspectives for studying 5 mC functions in chromatin regulation by
    in situ imaging with increased dynamic range. Two‐TALE test: Engineered
    transcription‐activator‐like effector (TALE) repeats can be used to
    design programmable receptors for improved in situ imaging‐based analysis
    of 5 mC in user‐defined DNA sequences. Pairs of natural 5 mC‐discriminating
    and engineered 5 mC‐binding TALEs allow nucleotide resolution analysis
    of 5 mC with response of both TALEs. This provides an impulse for the
    design of programmable imaging probes for studying 5 mC functions in
    chromatin regulation with increased dynamic range.'

- abstract: 5‐Methylcytosine (5mC), the central epigenetic mark of mammalian
    DNA, plays fundamental roles in chromatin regulation. 5mC is written
    onto genomes by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), and perturbation of this
    process is an early event in carcinogenesis. However, studying 5mC functions
    is limited by the inability to control individual DNMTs with spatiotemporal
    resolution in vivo. We report light‐control of DNMT catalysis by genetically
    encoding a photocaged cysteine as a catalytic residue. This enables
    translation of inactive DNMTs, their rapid activation by light‐decaging,
    and subsequent monitoring of de novo DNA methylation. We provide insights
    into how cancer‐related DNMT mutations alter de novo methylation in
    vivo, and demonstrate local and tuneable cytosine methylation by light‐controlled
    DNMTs fused to a programmable transcription activator‐like effector
    domain targeting pericentromeric satellite‐3 DNA. We further study early
    events of transcriptome alterations upon DNMT‐catalyzed cytosine methylation.
    Our study sets a basis to dissect the order and kinetics of diverse
    chromatin‐associated events triggered by normal and aberrant DNA methylation.

- abstract: Here we describe a time-efficient strategy for endogenous C-terminal
    gene tagging in mammalian tissue culture cells. An online platform is
    used to design two long gene-specific oligonucleotides for PCR with
    generic template cassettes to create linear dsDNA donors, termed PCR
    cassettes. PCR cassettes encode the tag (e.g., GFP), a Cas12a CRISPR
    RNA for cleavage of the target locus, and short homology arms for directed
    integration via homologous recombination. The integrated tag is coupled
    to a generic terminator shielding the tagged gene from the co-inserted
    auxiliary sequences. Co-transfection of PCR cassettes with a Cas12a-encoding
    plasmid leads to robust endogenous expression of tagged genes, with
    tagging efficiency of up to 20% without selection, and up to 60% when
    selection markers are used. We used target-enrichment sequencing to

    quick strategy particularly suitable for exploratory studies using endogenous

    by depositing oxidized 5mC derivatives and initiating active DNA demethylation.
    However, studying this dynamic is hampered by the inability to selectively

- abstract: 5-Methylcytosine (mC) exists in CpG dinucleotides of mammalian
    DNA and plays key roles in chromatin regulation during development and
    disease. As a main regulatory pathway, fully methylated CpG are recognized
    by methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins that act in concert with
    chromatin remodelers, histone deacetylases and methyltransferases to
    trigger transcriptional downregulation. In turn, MBD mutations can alter
    CpG binding, and in case of the MBD protein MeCP2 can cause the neurological
    disorder Rett syndrome (RTT). An additional layer of complexity in CpG
    recognition is added by ten-eleven-translocation (TET) dioxygenases
    that oxidize mC to 5-hydroxymethyl-, 5-formyl- and 5-carboxylcytosine,
    giving rise to fifteen possible combinations of cytosine modifications
    in the two CpG strands. We report a comprehensive, comparative interaction
    analysis of the human MBD proteins MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4
    with all CpG combinations and observe individual preferences of each
    MBD for distinct combinations. In addition, we profile four MeCP2 RTT
    mutants and reveal that although interactions to methylated CpGs are
    similarly affected by the mutations, interactions to oxidized mC combinations
    are differentially affected. These findings argue for a complex interplay
    between local TET activity/processivity and CpG recognition by MBDs,
    with potential consequences for the transcriptional landscape in normal
    and RTT states.

- abstract: Clone collections of modified strains (“libraries”) are a major
    resource for systematic studies with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
    Construction of such libraries is time-consuming, costly and confined
    to the genetic background of a specific yeast strain. To overcome these
    limitations, we present CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1)-assisted tag library engineering
    (CASTLING) for multiplexed strain construction. CASTLING uses microarray-synthesized
    oligonucleotide pools and in vitro recombineering to program the genomic
    insertion of long DNA constructs via homologous recombination. One simple
    transformation yields pooled libraries with >90% of correctly tagged
    clones. Up to several hundred genes can be tagged in a single step and,
    on a genomic scale, approximately half of all genes are tagged with
    only {~} 10-fold oversampling. We report several parameters that affect
    tagging success and provide a quantitative targeted next-generation
    sequencing method to analyze such pooled collections. Thus, CASTLING
    unlocks avenues for increasing throughput in functional genomics and
    cell biology research. Construction of yeast libraries is time-consuming,
    costly and limited to the genetic background of the chosen strain. Here
    the authors present CASTLING which uses CRISPR-Cas12a and oligonucleotide
    pools to rapidly generate pooled libraries with large insertions such
    as fluorescent protein tags.

- abstract: 5-Formylcytosine (5fC) is an epigenetic nucleobase of mammalian
    genomes that occurs as intermediate of active DNA demethylation. 5fC
    uniquely interacts and reacts with key nuclear proteins, indicating
    functions in genome regulation. Transcription-activator-like effectors
    (TALEs) are repeat-based DNA binding proteins that can serve as probes
    for the direct, programmable recognition and analysis of epigenetic
    nucleobases. However, no TALE repeats for the selective recognition
    of 5fC are available, and the typically low genomic levels of 5fC represent
    a particular sensitivity challenge. We here advance TALE-based nucleobase
    targeting from recognition to covalent cross-linking. We report TALE
    repeats bearing the ketone-amino acid p-acetylphenylalanine (pAcF) that
    universally bind all mammalian cytosine nucleobases, but selectively
    form diaminooxy-linker-mediated dioxime cross-links to 5fC. We identify
    repeat-linker combinations enabling single CpG resolution, and demonstrate
    the direct quantification of 5fC levels in a human genome background
    by covalent enrichment. This strategy provides a new avenue to expand
    the application scope of programmable probes with selectivity beyond
    A, G, T and C for epigenetic studies.

    Compounds 1–4 presented high binding affinities for GRPr (T47D, 0.56–3.51

    [68Ga]2 were mainly internalized while antagonists [68Ga]3 and [68Ga]4
    were surface bound. Cell-related radioactivity reached a maximum after
    45 min, while tracer levels followed GRPr expression (PC-3 > T47D >
    LNCaP > MDA-MB-231). [68Ga]4 showed the highest cell-bound radioactivity
    (PC-3 and T47D). In vivo, tumor (PC-3) targeting for [68Ga]3 and [68Ga]4
    increased over time, with dynamic μPET showing clearer tumors images
    at later time points. [68Ga]3 and [68Ga]4 can be considered suitable
    PET tracers for imaging PCa and BCa expressing GRPr.'

- abstract: 'Transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) are repeat-based
    proteins featuring programmable DNA binding. The repulsion of TALE repeats
    by 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its oxidized forms makes TALEs potential
    probes for their programmable analysis. However, this potential has
    been limited by the inability to engineer repeats capable of actual,
    fully selective binding of an (oxidized) 5mC: the extremely conserved
    and simple nucleobase recognition mode of TALE repeats and their extensive
    involvement in inter-repeat interactions that stabilize the TALE fold
    represent major engineering hurdles. We evaluated libraries of alternative,
    strongly truncated repeat scaffolds and discovered a repeat that selectively
    recognizes 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), enabling construction of the first
    programmable receptors for an oxidized 5mC. In computational studies,
    this unusual scaffold executes a dual function via a critical arginine
    that provides inter-repeat stabilization and selectively interacts with
    the 5caC carboxyl group via a salt-bridge. These findings argue for
    an unexpected adaptability of TALE repeats and provide a new impulse
    for the design of programmable probes for nucleobases beyond A, G, T
    and C.'

- abstract: Here we describe a C-SWAT library for high-throughput tagging
    of Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frames (ORFs). In 5,661 strains,
    we inserted an acceptor module after each ORF that can be efficiently
    replaced with tags or regulatory elements. We validated the library
    with targeted sequencing and tagged the proteome with bright fluorescent
    proteins to quantify the effect of heterologous transcription terminators
    on protein expression and to localize previously undetected proteins.
    A C-SWAT acceptor library allows the user to easily insert any tag of
    choice after yeast ORFs by swapping it for the acceptor module.
