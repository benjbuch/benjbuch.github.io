    Mammalian genomes are regulated by epigenetic cytosine (C) modifications
    in palindromic CpG dyads. Including canonical cytosine 5‐methylation
    (mC), a total of four different 5‐modifications can theoretically co‐exist
    in the two strands of a CpG, giving rise to a complex array of combinatorial
    marks with unique regulatory potentials. While tailored readers for
    individual marks could serve as versatile tools to study their functions,
    it has been unclear whether a natural protein scaffold would allow selective
    recognition of marks that vastly differ from canonical, symmetrically
    methylated CpGs. We conduct directed evolution experiments to generate
    readers of 5‐carboxylcytosine (caC) dyads based on the methyl‐CpG‐binding
    domain (MBD), the widely conserved natural reader of mC. Despite the
    stark steric and chemical differences to mC, we discover highly selective,
    low nanomolar binders of symmetric and asymmetric caC‐dyads. Together
    with mutational and modelling studies, our findings reveal a striking
    evolutionary flexibility of the MBD scaffold, allowing it to completely
    abandon its conserved mC recognition mode in favour of noncanonical
    dyad recognition, highlighting its potential for epigenetic reader design.
    Cytosine 5‐modifications–occurring in different combinations in the
    two DNA strands of CpG dyads–are central to human chromatin regulation,
    but the customized recognition of such combinatorial marks is challenging.
    By re‐evolving MBDs, the readers of canonical 5‐methylated CpGs, we
    identify strong and selective readers of noncanonical 5‐carboxylcytosine‐containing
    CpGs that have fully abandoned the conserved recognition of methylated
    CpGs.

    5-methylcytosine (mC) and its TET-oxidized derivatives exist in CpG
    dyads of mammalian DNA and regulate cell fate, but how their individual
    combinations in the two strands of a CpG act as distinct regulatory
    signals is poorly understood. Readers that selectively recognize such
    novel ‘CpG duplex marks’ could be versatile tools for studying their
    biological functions, but their design represents an unprecedented selectivity
    challenge. By mutational studies, NMR relaxation, and MD simulations,
    we here show that the selectivity of the first designer reader for an
    oxidized CpG duplex mark hinges on precisely tempered conformational
    plasticity of the scaffold adopted during directed evolution. Our observations
    reveal the critical aspect of defined motional features in this novel
    reader for affinity and specificity in the DNA/protein interaction,
    providing unexpected prospects for further design progress in this novel
    area of DNA recognition.

    RNA-binding proteins are essential regulators of RNA processing and
    function. Translational repression assays can be used to study how they
    interact with specific RNA sequences by insertion of such a consensus
    sequence into the 5’ untranslated region of a reporter mRNA and measuring
    reporter protein translation. The straightforward set-up of these translational
    repression assays avoids the need for the isolation of the protein or
    the RNA providing speed, robustness and a low-cost method. Here, we
    report the optimization of the assay to function with linear RNA sequences
    instead of the previously reported hairpin type sequences to allow the
    study of a wider variety of RNA-binding proteins. Multiplication of
    a consensus sequence strongly improves the signal allowing analysis
    by both fluorescence intensity measurements and flow cytometry.

    Ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases (TETs) are the erasers of 5-methylcytosine
    (mC), the central epigenetic regulator of mammalian DNA. TETs convert
    mC to three oxidized derivatives with unique physicochemical properties
    and inherent regulatory potential, and it initializes active demethylation
    by the base excision repair pathway. Potent small molecule inhibitors
    would be useful tools to study TET functions by conditional control.
    To facilitate the discovery of such tools, we here report a high-throughput
    screening pipeline and its application to screen and validate 31.5k
    compounds for inhibition of TET2. Using a homogenous fluorescence assay,
    we discover a novel quinoline-based scaffold that we further validate
    with an orthogonal semi-high throughput MALDI-MS assay for direct monitoring
    of substrate turnover. Structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies
    involving >20 derivatives of this scaffold led to the identification
    of optimized inhibitors, and together with computational studies suggested
    a plausible model for its mode of action.

    Transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) are programmable DNA
    binding proteins that can be used for sequence-specific, imaging-based
    analysis of cellular 5-methylcytosine. However, this has so far been
    limited to highly repetitive satellite DNA. To expand this approach
    to the analysis of coding single gene loci, we here explore a number
    of signal amplification strategies for increasing imaging sensitivity
    with TALEs. We develop a straightforward amplification protocol and
    employ it to target the MUC4 gene, which features only a small cluster
    of repeat sequences. This offers high sensitivity imaging of MUC4, and
    in costaining experiments with pairs of one TALE selective for unmethylated
    cytosine and one universal control TALE enables analyzing methylation
    changes in the target independently of changes in target accessibility.
    These advancements offer prospects for 5-methylcytosine analysis at
    coding, nonrepetitive gene loci by the use of designed TALE probe collections.

    5-Methylcytosine (mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC), the two main
    epigenetic modifications of mammalian DNA, exist in symmetric and asymmetric
    combinations in the two strands of CpG dyads. However, revealing such
    combinations in single DNA duplexes is a significant challenge. Here,
    we evolve methyl-CpG-binding domains (MBDs) derived from MeCP2 by bacterial
    cell surface display, resulting in the first affinity probes for hmC/mC
    CpGs. One mutant has low nanomolar affinity for a single hmC/mC CpG,
    discriminates against all 14 other modified CpG dyads, and rivals the
    selectivity of wild-type MeCP2. Structural studies indicate that this
    protein has a conserved scaffold and recognizes hmC and mC with two
    dedicated sets of residues. The mutant allows us to selectively address
    and enrich hmC/mC-containing DNA fragments from genomic DNA backgrounds.
    We anticipate that this novel probe will be a versatile tool to unravel
    the function of hmC/mC marks in diverse aspects of chromatin biology.

    Transcription-activator like effectors (TALEs) are DNA-binding proteins
    used for genome targeting. TALEs contain a central domain of concatenated
    repeats, of which each selectively recognizes one nucleobase at the
    DNA major groove. Based on this simple and predictable interaction with
    little context dependence, TALEs offer programmable targeting of user-defined
    DNA sequences. Since many epigenetic DNA modifications protrude into
    the DNA major groove, natural and engineered TALE repeats can provide
    “epigenetic” selectivity, making TALEs a flexible platform to design
    probes for the analysis of epigenetic DNA modifications. Here, we describe
    guidelines for the design of TALE proteins with selectivity for epigenetic
    cytosine 5-modifications, the validation of their interaction with modified
    DNA nucleobases, and their employment in affinity enrichment assays.
    These techniques enable quantification of epigenetic nucleobases in
    user-defined genomic DNA sequences with nucleotide and strand resolution.

    Modifications of the cytosine 5-position are dynamic epigenetic marks
    of mammalian DNA with important regulatory roles in development and
    disease. Unraveling biological functions of such modified nucleobases
    is tightly connected with the potential of available methods for their
    analysis. Whereas genome-wide nucleobase quantification and mapping
    are first-line analyses, targeted analyses move into focus the more
    genomic sites with high biological significance are identified. We here
    review recent developments in an emerging field that addresses such
    targeted analyses via probes that combine a programmable, sequence-specific
    DNA-binding domain with the ability to directly recognize or cross-link
    an epigenetically modified nucleobase of interest. We highlight how
    such probes offer simple, high-resolution nucleobase analyses in vitro
    and enable in situ correlations between a nucleobase and other chromatin
    regulatory elements at user-defined loci on the single-cell level by
    imaging.

    Transcription‐activator‐like effectors (TALEs) are repeat‐based, programmable
    DNA‐binding proteins that can be engineered to recognize sequences of
    canonical and epigenetically modified nucleobases. Fluorescent TALEs
    can be used for the imaging‐based analysis of cellular 5‐methylcytosine
    (5 mC) in repetitive DNA sequences. This is based on recording fluorescence
    ratios from cell co‐stains with two TALEs: an analytical TALE targeting
    the cytosine (C) position of interest through a C‐selective repeat that
    is blocked by 5 mC, and a control TALE targeting the position with a
    universal repeat that binds both C and 5 mC. To enhance this approach,
    we report herein the development of novel 5 mC‐selective repeats and
    their integration into TALEs that can replace universal TALEs in imaging‐based
    5 mC analysis, resulting in a methylation‐dependent response of both
    TALEs. We screened a library of size‐reduced repeats and identified
    several 5 mC binders. Compared to the 5 mC‐binding repeat of natural
    TALEs and to the universal repeat, two repeats containing aromatic residues
    showed enhancement of 5 mC binding and selectivity in cellular transcription
    activation and electromobility shift assays, respectively. In co‐stains
    of cellular SATIII DNA with a corresponding C‐selective TALE, this selectivity
    results in a positive methylation response of the new TALE, offering
    perspectives for studying 5 mC functions in chromatin regulation by
    in situ imaging with increased dynamic range. Two‐TALE test: Engineered
    transcription‐activator‐like effector (TALE) repeats can be used to
    design programmable receptors for improved in situ imaging‐based analysis
    of 5 mC in user‐defined DNA sequences. Pairs of natural 5 mC‐discriminating
    and engineered 5 mC‐binding TALEs allow nucleotide resolution analysis
    of 5 mC with response of both TALEs. This provides an impulse for the
    design of programmable imaging probes for studying 5 mC functions in
    chromatin regulation with increased dynamic range.

    5‐Methylcytosine (5mC), the central epigenetic mark of mammalian DNA,
    plays fundamental roles in chromatin regulation. 5mC is written onto
    genomes by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), and perturbation of this process
    is an early event in carcinogenesis. However, studying 5mC functions
    is limited by the inability to control individual DNMTs with spatiotemporal
    resolution in vivo. We report light‐control of DNMT catalysis by genetically
    encoding a photocaged cysteine as a catalytic residue. This enables
    translation of inactive DNMTs, their rapid activation by light‐decaging,
    and subsequent monitoring of de novo DNA methylation. We provide insights
    into how cancer‐related DNMT mutations alter de novo methylation in
    vivo, and demonstrate local and tuneable cytosine methylation by light‐controlled
    DNMTs fused to a programmable transcription activator‐like effector
    domain targeting pericentromeric satellite‐3 DNA. We further study early
    events of transcriptome alterations upon DNMT‐catalyzed cytosine methylation.
    Our study sets a basis to dissect the order and kinetics of diverse

    Ten-eleven-translocation (TET) dioxygenases catalyze the oxidation of
    5-methylcytosine (5mC), the central epigenetic regulator of mammalian
    DNA. This activity dynamically reshapes the epigenome and transcriptome
    by depositing oxidized 5mC derivatives and initiating active DNA demethylation.
    However, studying this dynamic is hampered by the inability to selectively
    activate individual TETs with temporal control in cells. We report activation
    of TETs in mammalian cells by incorporation of genetically encoded 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl-l-serine
    as a transient active-site block, and its subsequent deprotection with
    light. Our approach enables precise insights into the impact of cancer-associated

    Here we describe a time-efficient strategy for endogenous C-terminal
    gene tagging in mammalian tissue culture cells. An online platform is
    used to design two long gene-specific oligonucleotides for PCR with
    generic template cassettes to create linear dsDNA donors, termed PCR
    cassettes. PCR cassettes encode the tag (e.g., GFP), a Cas12a CRISPR
    RNA for cleavage of the target locus, and short homology arms for directed
    integration via homologous recombination. The integrated tag is coupled
    to a generic terminator shielding the tagged gene from the co-inserted
    auxiliary sequences. Co-transfection of PCR cassettes with a Cas12a-encoding
    plasmid leads to robust endogenous expression of tagged genes, with
    tagging efficiency of up to 20% without selection, and up to 60% when
    selection markers are used. We used target-enrichment sequencing to
    investigate all potential sources of artifacts. Our work outlines a
    quick strategy particularly suitable for exploratory studies using endogenous
    expression of fluorescent protein–tagged genes.

    We report programmable receptors for the imaging‐based analysis of 5‐methylcytosine
    (5mC) in user‐defined DNA sequences of single cells. Using fluorescent
    transcription‐activator‐like effectors (TALEs) that can recognize sequences
    of canonical and epigenetic nucleobases through selective repeats, we
    imaged cellular SATIII DNA, the origin of nuclear stress bodies (nSB).
    We achieve high nucleobase selectivity of natural repeats in imaging
    and demonstrate universal nucleobase binding by an engineered repeat.
    We use TALE pairs differing in only one such repeat in co‐stains to
    detect 5mC in SATIII sequences with nucleotide resolution independently
    of differences in target accessibility. Further, we directly correlate
    the presence of heat shock factor 1 with 5mC at its recognition sequence,
    revealing a potential function of 5mC in its recruitment as initial
    step of nSB formation. This opens a new avenue for studying 5mC functions
    in chromatin regulation in situ with nucleotide, locus, and cell resolution.
    It needs two TALEs to tango: Programmable receptors for the imaging‐based
    analysis of 5‐methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA sequences of single cells
    are reported. Staining of SATIII DNA with pairs of 5mC‐sensitive and
    5mC‐insensitive transcription‐activator‐like effectors (TALEs) allows
    the analysis of 5mC at a target nucleotide position and its direct correlation
    with the recruitment of transcription factor HSF1 as the initial step
    of nuclear stress body formation.

    5-Methylcytosine (mC) exists in CpG dinucleotides of mammalian DNA and
    plays key roles in chromatin regulation during development and disease.
    As a main regulatory pathway, fully methylated CpG are recognized by
    methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins that act in concert with chromatin
    remodelers, histone deacetylases and methyltransferases to trigger transcriptional
    downregulation. In turn, MBD mutations can alter CpG binding, and in
    case of the MBD protein MeCP2 can cause the neurological disorder Rett
    syndrome (RTT). An additional layer of complexity in CpG recognition
    is added by ten-eleven-translocation (TET) dioxygenases that oxidize
    mC to 5-hydroxymethyl-, 5-formyl- and 5-carboxylcytosine, giving rise
    to fifteen possible combinations of cytosine modifications in the two
    CpG strands. We report a comprehensive, comparative interaction analysis
    of the human MBD proteins MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4 with all
    CpG combinations and observe individual preferences of each MBD for
    distinct combinations. In addition, we profile four MeCP2 RTT mutants
    and reveal that although interactions to methylated CpGs are similarly
    affected by the mutations, interactions to oxidized mC combinations
    are differentially affected. These findings argue for a complex interplay
    between local TET activity/processivity and CpG recognition by MBDs,
    with potential consequences for the transcriptional landscape in normal
    and RTT states.

    Clone collections of modified strains (“libraries”) are a major resource
    for systematic studies with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Construction
    of such libraries is time-consuming, costly and confined to the genetic
    background of a specific yeast strain. To overcome these limitations,
    we present CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1)-assisted tag library engineering (CASTLING)
    for multiplexed strain construction. CASTLING uses microarray-synthesized
    oligonucleotide pools and in vitro recombineering to program the genomic
    insertion of long DNA constructs via homologous recombination. One simple
    transformation yields pooled libraries with >90% of correctly tagged
    clones. Up to several hundred genes can be tagged in a single step and,
    on a genomic scale, approximately half of all genes are tagged with
    only ~ 10-fold oversampling. We report several parameters that affect
    tagging success and provide a quantitative targeted next-generation
    sequencing method to analyze such pooled collections. Thus, CASTLING
    unlocks avenues for increasing throughput in functional genomics and
    cell biology research. Construction of yeast libraries is time-consuming,
    costly and limited to the genetic background of the chosen strain. Here
    the authors present CASTLING which uses CRISPR-Cas12a and oligonucleotide
    pools to rapidly generate pooled libraries with large insertions such
    as fluorescent protein tags.

    5-Formylcytosine (5fC) is an epigenetic nucleobase of mammalian genomes
    that occurs as intermediate of active DNA demethylation. 5fC uniquely
    interacts and reacts with key nuclear proteins, indicating functions
    in genome regulation. Transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs)
    are repeat-based DNA binding proteins that can serve as probes for the
    direct, programmable recognition and analysis of epigenetic nucleobases.
    However, no TALE repeats for the selective recognition of 5fC are available,
    and the typically low genomic levels of 5fC represent a particular sensitivity
    challenge. We here advance TALE-based nucleobase targeting from recognition
    to covalent cross-linking. We report TALE repeats bearing the ketone-amino
    acid p-acetylphenylalanine (pAcF) that universally bind all mammalian
    cytosine nucleobases, but selectively form diaminooxy-linker-mediated
    dioxime cross-links to 5fC. We identify repeat-linker combinations enabling
    single CpG resolution, and demonstrate the direct quantification of
    5fC levels in a human genome background by covalent enrichment. This
    strategy provides a new avenue to expand the application scope of programmable
    probes with selectivity beyond A, G, T and C for epigenetic studies.

    Transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) are repeat-based proteins
    featuring programmable DNA binding. The repulsion of TALE repeats by
    5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its oxidized forms makes TALEs potential
    probes for their programmable analysis. However, this potential has
    been limited by the inability to engineer repeats capable of actual,
    fully selective binding of an (oxidized) 5mC: the extremely conserved
    and simple nucleobase recognition mode of TALE repeats and their extensive
    involvement in inter-repeat interactions that stabilize the TALE fold
    represent major engineering hurdles. We evaluated libraries of alternative,
    strongly truncated repeat scaffolds and discovered a repeat that selectively
    recognizes 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), enabling construction of the first
    programmable receptors for an oxidized 5mC. In computational studies,
    this unusual scaffold executes a dual function via a critical arginine
    that provides inter-repeat stabilization and selectively interacts with
    the 5caC carboxyl group via a salt-bridge. These findings argue for
    an unexpected adaptability of TALE repeats and provide a new impulse
    for the design of programmable probes for nucleobases beyond A, G, T
    and C.

    Here we describe a C-SWAT library for high-throughput tagging of Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae open reading frames (ORFs). In 5,661 strains, we inserted
    an acceptor module after each ORF that can be efficiently replaced with
    tags or regulatory elements. We validated the library with targeted
    sequencing and tagged the proteome with bright fluorescent proteins
    to quantify the effect of heterologous transcription terminators on
    protein expression and to localize previously undetected proteins. A
    C-SWAT acceptor library allows the user to easily insert any tag of
    choice after yeast ORFs by swapping it for the acceptor module.

    The GRPr, highly expressed in prostate PCa and breast cancer BCa, is
    a promising target for the development of new PET radiotracers. The
    chelator HBED-CC (N,N′-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic
    acid) was coupled to the bombesin peptides: HBED-C-BN(2–14) 1, HBED-CC-PEG2-[d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Thi13,Nle14]-BN(6–14)
    2, HBED-CC-Y-[d-Phe6,Sta13,Leu14]-BN(6–14) (Y = 4-amino-1-carboxymethylpiperidine)
    3, and HBED-CC- PEG2-Y-[d-Phe6,Sta13,Leu14]-BN(6–14) 2 4 (homodimer).
    Compounds 1–4 presented high binding affinities for GRPr (T47D, 0.56–3.51
    nM; PC-3, 2.12–4.68 nM). In PC-3 and T47D cells, agonists [68Ga]1 and
    [68Ga]2 were mainly internalized while antagonists [68Ga]3 and [68Ga]4
    were surface bound. Cell-related radioactivity reached a maximum after
    45 min, while tracer levels followed GRPr expression (PC-3 > T47D >
    LNCaP > MDA-MB-231). [68Ga]4 showed the highest cell-bound radioactivity
    (PC-3 and T47D). In vivo, tumor (PC-3) targeting for [68Ga]3 and [68Ga]4
    increased over time, with dynamic μPET showing clearer tumors images
    at later time points. [68Ga]3 and [68Ga]4 can be considered suitable
    PET tracers for imaging PCa and BCa expressing GRPr.
