  title: Evolved Readers of 5‐Carboxylcytosine CpG Dyads Reveal a High Versatility of the Methyl‐CpG‐Binding Domain for Recognition

  abstract: Mammalian genomes are regulated by epigenetic cytosine (C) modifications in palindromic CpG dyads. Including canonical
    cytosine 5‐methylation (mC), a total of four different 5‐modifications can theoretically co‐exist in the two strands of
    a CpG, giving rise to a complex array of combinatorial marks with unique regulatory potentials. While tailored readers
    for individual marks could serve as versatile tools to study their functions, it has been unclear whether a natural protein
    scaffold would allow selective recognition of marks that vastly differ from canonical, symmetrically methylated CpGs.
    We conduct directed evolution experiments to generate readers of 5‐carboxylcytosine (caC) dyads based on the methyl‐CpG‐binding
    domain (MBD), the widely conserved natural reader of mC. Despite the stark steric and chemical differences to mC, we discover
    highly selective, low nanomolar binders of symmetric and asymmetric caC‐dyads. Together with mutational and modelling
    studies, our findings reveal a striking evolutionary flexibility of the MBD scaffold, allowing it to completely abandon
    its conserved mC recognition mode in favour of noncanonical dyad recognition, highlighting its potential for epigenetic
    reader design. Cytosine 5‐modifications–occurring in different combinations in the two DNA strands of CpG dyads–are central
    to human chromatin regulation, but the customized recognition of such combinatorial marks is challenging. By re‐evolving
    MBDs, the readers of canonical 5‐methylated CpGs, we identify strong and selective readers of noncanonical 5‐carboxylcytosine‐containing
    CpGs that have fully abandoned the conserved recognition of methylated CpGs.

  abstract: 5-methylcytosine (mC) and its TET-oxidized derivatives exist in CpG dyads of mammalian DNA and regulate cell fate,
    but how their individual combinations in the two strands of a CpG act as distinct regulatory signals is poorly understood.
    Readers that selectively recognize such novel ‘CpG duplex marks’ could be versatile tools for studying their biological
    functions, but their design represents an unprecedented selectivity challenge. By mutational studies, NMR relaxation,
    and MD simulations, we here show that the selectivity of the first designer reader for an oxidized CpG duplex mark hinges
    on precisely tempered conformational plasticity of the scaffold adopted during directed evolution. Our observations reveal
    the critical aspect of defined motional features in this novel reader for affinity and specificity in the DNA/protein
    interaction, providing unexpected prospects for further design progress in this novel area of DNA recognition.

  abstract: RNA-binding proteins are essential regulators of RNA processing and function. Translational repression assays
    can be used to study how they interact with specific RNA sequences by insertion of such a consensus sequence into the
    5’ untranslated region of a reporter mRNA and measuring reporter protein translation. The straightforward set-up of these
    translational repression assays avoids the need for the isolation of the protein or the RNA providing speed, robustness
    and a low-cost method. Here, we report the optimization of the assay to function with linear RNA sequences instead of
    the previously reported hairpin type sequences to allow the study of a wider variety of RNA-binding proteins. Multiplication
    of a consensus sequence strongly improves the signal allowing analysis by both fluorescence intensity measurements and
    flow cytometry.

  abstract: Ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases (TETs) are the erasers of 5-methylcytosine (mC), the central epigenetic
    regulator of mammalian DNA. TETs convert mC to three oxidized derivatives with unique physicochemical properties and inherent
    regulatory potential, and it initializes active demethylation by the base excision repair pathway. Potent small molecule
    inhibitors would be useful tools to study TET functions by conditional control. To facilitate the discovery of such tools,
    we here report a high-throughput screening pipeline and its application to screen and validate 31.5k compounds for inhibition
    of TET2. Using a homogenous fluorescence assay, we discover a novel quinoline-based scaffold that we further validate
    with an orthogonal semi-high throughput MALDI-MS assay for direct monitoring of substrate turnover. Structure–activity
    relationship (SAR) studies involving >20 derivatives of this scaffold led to the identification of optimized inhibitors,
    and together with computational studies suggested a plausible model for its mode of action.

  abstract: Transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) are programmable DNA binding proteins that can be used for sequence-specific,
    imaging-based analysis of cellular 5-methylcytosine. However, this has so far been limited to highly repetitive satellite
    DNA. To expand this approach to the analysis of coding single gene loci, we here explore a number of signal amplification
    strategies for increasing imaging sensitivity with TALEs. We develop a straightforward amplification protocol and employ
    it to target the MUC4 gene, which features only a small cluster of repeat sequences. This offers high sensitivity imaging
    of MUC4, and in costaining experiments with pairs of one TALE selective for unmethylated cytosine and one universal control
    TALE enables analyzing methylation changes in the target independently of changes in target accessibility. These advancements
    offer prospects for 5-methylcytosine analysis at coding, nonrepetitive gene loci by the use of designed TALE probe collections.

  abstract: 5-Methylcytosine (mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC), the two main epigenetic modifications of mammalian DNA,
    exist in symmetric and asymmetric combinations in the two strands of CpG dyads. However, revealing such combinations in
    single DNA duplexes is a significant challenge. Here, we evolve methyl-CpG-binding domains (MBDs) derived from MeCP2 by
    bacterial cell surface display, resulting in the first affinity probes for hmC/mC CpGs. One mutant has low nanomolar affinity
    for a single hmC/mC CpG, discriminates against all 14 other modified CpG dyads, and rivals the selectivity of wild-type
    MeCP2. Structural studies indicate that this protein has a conserved scaffold and recognizes hmC and mC with two dedicated
    sets of residues. The mutant allows us to selectively address and enrich hmC/mC-containing DNA fragments from genomic
    DNA backgrounds. We anticipate that this novel probe will be a versatile tool to unravel the function of hmC/mC marks
    in diverse aspects of chromatin biology.

  abstract: Transcription-activator like effectors (TALEs) are DNA-binding proteins used for genome targeting. TALEs contain
    a central domain of concatenated repeats, of which each selectively recognizes one nucleobase at the DNA major groove.
    Based on this simple and predictable interaction with little context dependence, TALEs offer programmable targeting of
    user-defined DNA sequences. Since many epigenetic DNA modifications protrude into the DNA major groove, natural and engineered
    TALE repeats can provide “epigenetic” selectivity, making TALEs a flexible platform to design probes for the analysis
    of epigenetic DNA modifications. Here, we describe guidelines for the design of TALE proteins with selectivity for epigenetic
    cytosine 5-modifications, the validation of their interaction with modified DNA nucleobases, and their employment in affinity
    enrichment assays. These techniques enable quantification of epigenetic nucleobases in user-defined genomic DNA sequences
    with nucleotide and strand resolution.

  abstract: Modifications of the cytosine 5-position are dynamic epigenetic marks of mammalian DNA with important regulatory
    roles in development and disease. Unraveling biological functions of such modified nucleobases is tightly connected with
    the potential of available methods for their analysis. Whereas genome-wide nucleobase quantification and mapping are first-line
    analyses, targeted analyses move into focus the more genomic sites with high biological significance are identified. We
    here review recent developments in an emerging field that addresses such targeted analyses via probes that combine a programmable,
    sequence-specific DNA-binding domain with the ability to directly recognize or cross-link an epigenetically modified nucleobase
    of interest. We highlight how such probes offer simple, high-resolution nucleobase analyses in vitro and enable in situ
    correlations between a nucleobase and other chromatin regulatory elements at user-defined loci on the single-cell level
    by imaging.

  abstract: 'Transcription‐activator‐like effectors (TALEs) are repeat‐based, programmable DNA‐binding proteins that can be
    engineered to recognize sequences of canonical and epigenetically modified nucleobases. Fluorescent TALEs can be used
    for the imaging‐based analysis of cellular 5‐methylcytosine (5 mC) in repetitive DNA sequences. This is based on recording
    fluorescence ratios from cell co‐stains with two TALEs: an analytical TALE targeting the cytosine (C) position of interest
    through a C‐selective repeat that is blocked by 5 mC, and a control TALE targeting the position with a universal repeat
    that binds both C and 5 mC. To enhance this approach, we report herein the development of novel 5 mC‐selective repeats
    and their integration into TALEs that can replace universal TALEs in imaging‐based 5 mC analysis, resulting in a methylation‐dependent
    response of both TALEs. We screened a library of size‐reduced repeats and identified several 5 mC binders. Compared to
    the 5 mC‐binding repeat of natural TALEs and to the universal repeat, two repeats containing aromatic residues showed
    enhancement of 5 mC binding and selectivity in cellular transcription activation and electromobility shift assays, respectively.
    In co‐stains of cellular SATIII DNA with a corresponding C‐selective TALE, this selectivity results in a positive methylation
    response of the new TALE, offering perspectives for studying 5 mC functions in chromatin regulation by in situ imaging
    with increased dynamic range. Two‐TALE test: Engineered transcription‐activator‐like effector (TALE) repeats can be used
    to design programmable receptors for improved in situ imaging‐based analysis of 5 mC in user‐defined DNA sequences. Pairs
    of natural 5 mC‐discriminating and engineered 5 mC‐binding TALEs allow nucleotide resolution analysis of 5 mC with response
    of both TALEs. This provides an impulse for the design of programmable imaging probes for studying 5 mC functions in chromatin
    regulation with increased dynamic range.'

  abstract: 5‐Methylcytosine (5mC), the central epigenetic mark of mammalian DNA, plays fundamental roles in chromatin regulation.
    5mC is written onto genomes by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), and perturbation of this process is an early event in carcinogenesis.
    However, studying 5mC functions is limited by the inability to control individual DNMTs with spatiotemporal resolution
    in vivo. We report light‐control of DNMT catalysis by genetically encoding a photocaged cysteine as a catalytic residue.
    This enables translation of inactive DNMTs, their rapid activation by light‐decaging, and subsequent monitoring of de
    novo DNA methylation. We provide insights into how cancer‐related DNMT mutations alter de novo methylation in vivo, and
    demonstrate local and tuneable cytosine methylation by light‐controlled DNMTs fused to a programmable transcription activator‐like
    effector domain targeting pericentromeric satellite‐3 DNA. We further study early events of transcriptome alterations
    upon DNMT‐catalyzed cytosine methylation. Our study sets a basis to dissect the order and kinetics of diverse chromatin‐associated
    events triggered by normal and aberrant DNA methylation. We report light activation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) through
    the genetic encoding of a photocaged cysteine. This enables insights into the impact of cancer‐related DNMT mutations
    on in vivo catalysis, enables local and tuneable methylation via DNMT‐TAL‐effector fusions, and provides insights into
    methylation‐triggered transcriptome dynamics.

  abstract: Ten-eleven-translocation (TET) dioxygenases catalyze the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), the central epigenetic
    regulator of mammalian DNA. This activity dynamically reshapes the epigenome and transcriptome by depositing oxidized
    5mC derivatives and initiating active DNA demethylation. However, studying this dynamic is hampered by the inability to
    selectively activate individual TETs with temporal control in cells. We report activation of TETs in mammalian cells by
    incorporation of genetically encoded 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl-l-serine as a transient active-site block, and its subsequent
    deprotection with light. Our approach enables precise insights into the impact of cancer-associated TET2 mutations on
    the kinetics of TET2 catalysis in vivo, and allows time-resolved monitoring of target gene activation and transcriptome
    reorganization. This sets a basis for dissecting the order and kinetics of chromatin-associated events triggered by TET
    catalysis, ranging from DNA demethylation to chromatin and transcription regulation.

  abstract: Here we describe a time-efficient strategy for endogenous C-terminal gene tagging in mammalian tissue culture
    cells. An online platform is used to design two long gene-specific oligonucleotides for PCR with generic template cassettes
    to create linear dsDNA donors, termed PCR cassettes. PCR cassettes encode the tag (e.g., GFP), a Cas12a CRISPR RNA for
    cleavage of the target locus, and short homology arms for directed integration via homologous recombination. The integrated
    tag is coupled to a generic terminator shielding the tagged gene from the co-inserted auxiliary sequences. Co-transfection
    of PCR cassettes with a Cas12a-encoding plasmid leads to robust endogenous expression of tagged genes, with tagging efficiency
    of up to 20% without selection, and up to 60% when selection markers are used. We used target-enrichment sequencing to
    investigate all potential sources of artifacts. Our work outlines a quick strategy particularly suitable for exploratory
    studies using endogenous expression of fluorescent protein–tagged genes.

    the presence of heat shock factor 1 with 5mC at its recognition sequence, revealing a potential function of 5mC in its

  abstract: 5-Methylcytosine (mC) exists in CpG dinucleotides of mammalian DNA and plays key roles in chromatin regulation
    during development and disease. As a main regulatory pathway, fully methylated CpG are recognized by methyl-CpG-binding
    domain (MBD) proteins that act in concert with chromatin remodelers, histone deacetylases and methyltransferases to trigger
    transcriptional downregulation. In turn, MBD mutations can alter CpG binding, and in case of the MBD protein MeCP2 can
    cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome (RTT). An additional layer of complexity in CpG recognition is added by
    ten-eleven-translocation (TET) dioxygenases that oxidize mC to 5-hydroxymethyl-, 5-formyl- and 5-carboxylcytosine, giving
    rise to fifteen possible combinations of cytosine modifications in the two CpG strands. We report a comprehensive, comparative
    interaction analysis of the human MBD proteins MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4 with all CpG combinations and observe
    individual preferences of each MBD for distinct combinations. In addition, we profile four MeCP2 RTT mutants and reveal
    that although interactions to methylated CpGs are similarly affected by the mutations, interactions to oxidized mC combinations
    are differentially affected. These findings argue for a complex interplay between local TET activity/processivity and
    CpG recognition by MBDs, with potential consequences for the transcriptional landscape in normal and RTT states.

    recombineering to program the genomic insertion of long DNA constructs via homologous recombination. One simple transformation
    yields pooled libraries with >90% of correctly tagged clones. Up to several hundred genes can be tagged in a single step
    and, on a genomic scale, approximately half of all genes are tagged with only {~} 10-fold oversampling. We report several
    parameters that affect tagging success and provide a quantitative targeted next-generation sequencing method to analyze
    such pooled collections. Thus, CASTLING unlocks avenues for increasing throughput in functional genomics and cell biology
    research. Construction of yeast libraries is time-consuming, costly and limited to the genetic background of the chosen
    strain. Here the authors present CASTLING which uses CRISPR-Cas12a and oligonucleotide pools to rapidly generate pooled
    libraries with large insertions such as fluorescent protein tags.

  title: Programmable Protein–DNA Cross-Linking for the Direct Capture and Quantification of 5‑Formylcytosine

  abstract: 5-Formylcytosine (5fC) is an epigenetic nucleobase of mammalian genomes that occurs as intermediate of active
    DNA demethylation. 5fC uniquely interacts and reacts with key nuclear proteins, indicating functions in genome regulation.
    Transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) are repeat-based DNA binding proteins that can serve as probes for the
    direct, programmable recognition and analysis of epigenetic nucleobases. However, no TALE repeats for the selective recognition
    of 5fC are available, and the typically low genomic levels of 5fC represent a particular sensitivity challenge. We here
    advance TALE-based nucleobase targeting from recognition to covalent cross-linking. We report TALE repeats bearing the
    ketone-amino acid p-acetylphenylalanine (pAcF) that universally bind all mammalian cytosine nucleobases, but selectively
    form diaminooxy-linker-mediated dioxime cross-links to 5fC. We identify repeat-linker combinations enabling single CpG
    resolution, and demonstrate the direct quantification of 5fC levels in a human genome background by covalent enrichment.
    This strategy provides a new avenue to expand the application scope of programmable probes with selectivity beyond A,
    G, T and C for epigenetic studies.

  abstract: 'Transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) are repeat-based proteins featuring programmable DNA binding.
    The repulsion of TALE repeats by 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its oxidized forms makes TALEs potential probes for their
    programmable analysis. However, this potential has been limited by the inability to engineer repeats capable of actual,
    fully selective binding of an (oxidized) 5mC: the extremely conserved and simple nucleobase recognition mode of TALE repeats
    and their extensive involvement in inter-repeat interactions that stabilize the TALE fold represent major engineering
    hurdles. We evaluated libraries of alternative, strongly truncated repeat scaffolds and discovered a repeat that selectively
    recognizes 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), enabling construction of the first programmable receptors for an oxidized 5mC. In
    computational studies, this unusual scaffold executes a dual function via a critical arginine that provides inter-repeat
    stabilization and selectively interacts with the 5caC carboxyl group via a salt-bridge. These findings argue for an unexpected
    adaptability of TALE repeats and provide a new impulse for the design of programmable probes for nucleobases beyond A,
    G, T and C.'

  abstract: Here we describe a C-SWAT library for high-throughput tagging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frames
    (ORFs). In 5,661 strains, we inserted an acceptor module after each ORF that can be efficiently replaced with tags or
    regulatory elements. We validated the library with targeted sequencing and tagged the proteome with bright fluorescent
    proteins to quantify the effect of heterologous transcription terminators on protein expression and to localize previously
    undetected proteins. A C-SWAT acceptor library allows the user to easily insert any tag of choice after yeast ORFs by
    swapping it for the acceptor module.

    surface bound. Cell-related radioactivity reached a maximum after 45 min, while tracer levels followed GRPr expression
    (PC-3 > T47D > LNCaP > MDA-MB-231). [68Ga]4 showed the highest cell-bound radioactivity (PC-3 and T47D). In vivo, tumor
    (PC-3) targeting for [68Ga]3 and [68Ga]4 increased over time, with dynamic μPET showing clearer tumors images at later
