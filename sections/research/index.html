<p>My work focuses on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do small chemical changes in chromatin control cell-type-specific gene regulation?</li>
  <li>How do diseases exploit or disrupt epigenetic mechanisms?</li>
</ul>

<p>I study these questions using chemical biology approaches, pooled genetic screens, and integrated analysis of multi-omics data, connecting molecular features to regulatory outcomes and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.</p>
