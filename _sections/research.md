## Research interests

My work focuses on:

* How do small chemical changes in chromatin control cell-type-specific gene regulation?
* How do diseases exploit or disrupt these epigenetic mechanisms?

I study these questions using chemical biology approaches, pooled genetic screens, and integrated analysis of multi-omics data, connecting molecular features to regulatory outcomes and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.
