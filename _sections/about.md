Hi, I’m {{ page.hero }}!

I am an Associate Research Scholar and former EMBO Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University where I work with [Prof. Tom Muir](https://muir.princeton.edu/) on **how cancer seizes control of gene regulation**.

In 2021, I received my PhD in Chemical Biology, advised by [Prof. Daniel Summerer](https://ccb.tu-dortmund.de/en/professorships/cb/summerer/), for developing **proteins that recognize rare DNA modifications** in the human genome.
