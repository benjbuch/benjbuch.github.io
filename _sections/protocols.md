I've become interested in tackling a common lab problem: **knowing whether your printed protocol is still current** and what to do about all the scribbled notes. These self-curated, version-controlled documents can make that easier.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include protocol-index.html %}
{:/nomarkdown}

### Using these protocols

- **Download** — Click on any protocol above to get the current PDF
- **Reference** — Use the stable identifier (e.g., `SOP0101-v1`) in your notes
- **Verify** — [Check](/check) if your printed copy is still up to date
